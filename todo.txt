2. Load data from gsheet
  - Automatically remove duplicates, using only the last entry
  - Still have to manually fix names where they didn't capitalize properly or possibly used a slightly different spelling for their name: Just make changes directly on gsheet
  a. Add new entries to main web page in near real time using a daemon that continuously runs from the time the form is opened for entries to the time data is loaded on the website
    i. Only include names and entry times
    ii. Sortable by name or entry time
  b. Load player data directly from gsheet instead of players.csv
    i. Do this only on-demand
    ii. Still have to map guesses to nominees for categoryMaps.xml
