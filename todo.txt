1. Add ability to check hypothetical winners

It may be possible to add check boxes for all categories so people can select hypothetical winners.  Then send that to an HTML file with JQuery and use JavaScript to predict the possible scores and rankings.

2. Load data from gsheet
  - Automatically remove duplicates, using only the last entry
  - Still have to manually fix names where they didn't capitalize properly or possibly used a slightly different spelling for their name: Just make changes directly on gsheet
  a. Add new entries to main web page in near real time using a daemon that continuously runs from the time the form is opened for entries to the time data is loaded on the website
    i. Only include names and entry times
    ii. Sortable by name or entry time
    iii. Send email to player with guesses
      I. Make email required in form
      II. Add check box for opt-in of receipt email
  b. Load player data directly from gsheet instead of players.csv
    i. Do this only on-demand
    ii. Still have to map guesses to nominees for categoryMaps.xml

On Google Sheet
1. Select File -> Share -> Publish to web
2. Choose Link = Form Responses 1 (the tab name) and Embed = Comma-separated values (.csv)
3. Check box for "Automatically rebulish when changes are made"
4. Click "Publish"
5. Copy the URL it generates and use that for downloading the CSV file
